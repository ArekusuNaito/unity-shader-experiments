# unity-shader-experiments
A tiny project to test the Blend Modes with shaders.

This project was made just to learn more about shaders.
- Created a Plain Color Shader
- Created a Texture Shader
- Created a Sprite Shader (This ones are different are were made with the the Sprite-default from Unity)
- Created a .cginc file to import every basic sprite shader to any other shader I create.
- Pretty much what you should try, if you are learning this stuff is try to use the `Blend <SrcFactor> <DstFactor>` instructions, also use the `BlendOp <Operation>` to try more effects.
